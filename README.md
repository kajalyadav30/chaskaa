## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for package management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kajalyadav30/Chaskaa.git
    cd Chaskaa
    ```
2. **Install dependencies for the frontend, backend, and admin dashboard**:
   - For Frontend:
     ```bash
       cd Frontend
       npm install
     ```
   - For Backend:
     ```bash
       cd ../Backend
       npm install
     ```
   - For Admin Dashboard:
     ```bash
       cd ../Admin
       npm install
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm run server
   ```
   This will start the backend server on the specified port (default is `http://localhost:4000`).  
   You can change the port from [server.js]

2. **Start the Frontend (Customer Portal)**:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the customer-facing frontend on `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Start the Admin Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   cd Admin
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the admin dashboard on `http://localhost:5174`.

### Environment Variables

Each part of the project (Frontend, Backend, Admin) requires its own `.env` file with appropriate environment variables.

1. **Backend**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the **Backend** folder with the following variables:
   ```
   DB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

2. **Frontend**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the **Frontend** folder with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000 or Your Deployed Backend URL
   ```

3. **Admin Dashboard**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the **Admin** folder with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000 or Your Deployed Backend URL
   ```

## Repository Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Frontend**:  
   The customer-facing food ordering platform is built using **React (Vite)**. This section handles user interactions, displaying food items, and managing the cart and checkout process.

2. **Backend**:  
   The server-side API, built with **Node.js** and **Express**, handles data processing, database operations, and serves requests from both the frontend and admin dashboard.

3. **Admin Dashboard**:  
   A dedicated admin interface built using **React (Vite)**, allowing admins to manage food items, orders, and promocodes. It is connected to the backend for data management and order processing.
